🚀 Ecommerce Store 🛍️

"Revolutionizing online shopping experiences with a seamless and intuitive interface"

📖 Description

The Ecommerce Store is a modern React frontend application built to deliver a smooth and intuitive online shopping experience. It provides customers with a clean interface to browse, search, and manage products with ease.

Designed with a mobile-first approach, the application ensures seamless responsiveness across all devices. The project follows a modular component-based architecture, making it easy to extend, customize, and maintain.

Since this is a frontend-only implementation, the app integrates with a mock API (FakeStoreAPI) to fetch product data. This allows developers to focus on UI/UX without needing a backend setup.

✨ Features

The Ecommerce Store includes the following features:

1.**Product Catalog** – Browse products with category-based organization

2.**Search Functionality** – Real-time search to quickly find products by name

3.**Shopping Cart** – Add, remove, and update product quantities with persistence

4.**Product Details** – View detailed product descriptions, prices, and images

5.**Responsive Design** – Mobile-friendly layout that adapts to all screen sizes

6.**Navbar with Search** – Dynamic navigation bar with integrated search box

7.**Reusable Components** – Modular React components for scalability

8.**Filter & Sort (Planned)** – Easy filtering and sorting by category, price, or relevance

9.**Modern UI/UX** – Smooth transitions, hover effects, and clean layouts

10.**Frontend-Only** Implementation – Uses FakeStoreAPI for product data
